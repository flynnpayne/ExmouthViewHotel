Assignment for BCDE151 User Experience as part of the Diploma of Website Development and Design at Ara Institute of Canterbury.

For this assignment I had to examine an existing website for any user experience issues and write a document explaining why the issue is bad from a UX perspective, and then explain what can be done to fix it. After that I had to redesign and build the website to fix these UX issues.

I got a mark of 100% for this assignment.
